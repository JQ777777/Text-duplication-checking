In a small village nestled in the heart of a vast forest. there lived a cute boy named Tom. Tom was known for his adventurous spirit and his exploring the unknown. Every day, he would venture into the forest and river. discovering new wonders and meeting all sorts of creatures. One day, while wandering longer than before. he stumbled upon an ancient, hidden cave. On the outskirts of a city, a young girl named Lily spent her days dreaming of places and magical adventures. Unlike most children her age, she preferred the company of books  of her own thoughts. One sunny afternoon, as she was reading bookes before a big oak tree. she noticed a peculiar, shimmering portal appear before her eyes. Without hesitation, she stepped through it. finding herself transported to a world filled with enchantment and mystery. Little did she know, this was only the beginning of her extraordinary journey.
